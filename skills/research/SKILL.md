# Research Skill — Multi-Level Search

## Search Level Strategy

Always use the lowest level that can answer the question:

| Level | Tool | Use Case | Cost |
|-------|------|----------|------|
| 0 | Built-in knowledge | Common concepts, basics | Free |
| 1 | `web_search` | Quick verification, simple queries | Free |
| 2 | Tavily Research API | Deep research, competitive analysis | API credits |

**Rule**: If Level 0 or 1 can answer it, don't use Level 2.

**Don't need research**: Common knowledge, already in `knowledge/`, answerable from built-in knowledge.

## Level 2: Tavily Research API

### Prerequisites

Get your API key at https://tavily.com (1000 free credits/month)

Set environment variable:
```bash
export TAVILY_API_KEY="tvly-your-key-here"
```

Or add to your agent config:
```json
{
  "env": {
    "TAVILY_API_KEY": "tvly-your-key-here"
  }
}
```

### Usage

```bash
./scripts/research.sh '{"input": "your research query"}' [output_file]

# Quick research
./scripts/research.sh '{"input": "quantum computing trends"}'

# Deep research
./scripts/research.sh '{"input": "AI agents comparison", "model": "pro"}'

# Save to file
./scripts/research.sh '{"input": "market analysis", "model": "pro"}' ./report.md
```

### Model Selection

| Model | Use Case | Speed |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `mini` | Single topic, targeted | ~30s |
| `pro` | Multi-angle, comprehensive | ~60-120s |
| `auto` | API chooses based on complexity | Varies |

**Rule of thumb**: "what does X do?" → mini. "X vs Y vs Z" → pro.

### Structured Output

```bash
./scripts/research.sh '{
  "input": "fintech startups 2025",
  "model": "pro",
  "output_schema": {
    "properties": {
      "summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Executive summary"},
      "companies": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}
    },
    "required": ["summary"]
  }
}'
```

### Citation Formats

Supported: `numbered` (default), `mla`, `apa`, `chicago`

```bash
./scripts/research.sh '{"input": "climate impacts", "citation_format": "apa"}'
```

## Post-Research 沉淀 Checkpoint

After completing research, before writing findings or recommendations:

**Socratic validation (mandatory for each recommendation/gap/optimization):**
1. Does this problem actually exist in the current codebase? Check existing solutions first.
2. Is the proposed fix feasible on all target platforms (Kiro + CC)? Check constraints.
3. Does the benefit outweigh the maintenance cost?

If any answer is "no" → drop that recommendation. Don't include it in findings.

**Then persist:**
1. Record validated findings in `docs/plans/findings.md` (if working on a plan)
2. If findings reveal reusable patterns → write to `knowledge/episodes.md`
3. Cite sources with URLs — no hallucinated references
