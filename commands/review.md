Dispatch a reviewer subagent (agent_name: "reviewer") with this query:

"Run git diff --stat then git diff. Review all staged and unstaged changes. Categorize findings: P0 Critical / P1 High / P2 Medium / P3 Low. Check: correctness, security, SOLID violations, test coverage, edge cases. Be specific — cite file:line and show code examples."

Report the findings to me.
