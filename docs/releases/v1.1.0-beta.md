# v1.1.0-beta

> Second beta release — context optimization, parallel worktree execution, knowledge auto-evolution.

## Highlights

- **Knowledge Auto-Evolution** — Distillation engine auto-compacts episodes into rules; severity tracking for auto-captured learnings; integration test scaffold
- **Ralph Loop Parallel Worktree** — Tasks execute in isolated git worktrees then merge back; stall detection via heartbeat; fork bomb eliminated
- **Context Optimization** — Hook output streamlining, episodes distillation, skill resource pruning in config generation
- **Brainstorming → Planning Phase 0** — Brainstorming merged into planning Phase 0 for a single unified flow
- **Review Flow Optimization** — Review round cap reduced from 5 to 3; Round 2+ reviewer count reduced; fill-in templates for Completeness and Testability angles
- **Claude Code Parity** — CC integration tests upgraded to effect-based assertions; dual-platform documentation updated

## Bug Fixes

- Ralph loop verify cmd extraction now supports fenced code blocks
- Fix orphan child processes after ralph_loop is killed
- Eliminate fork bomb via precheck exclusion and recursion guard
- Worker prompt instructs git commit for worktree merge to work
- Skip redundant verify/test in completion hook during ralph loop
- Enforce-ralph-loop cd prefix strip and allowlist fixes
